Archie is a Java library for stream-based manipulation of `zip`, `jar`, and `tar.gz` files. Rather than explode and reassemble archives, Archie applies transformations on-the-fly with a simple and expressive callback model.

== Features

- Works with `zip`, `jar`, and `tar.gz` formats
- Stream-friendly: avoids unzip → modify → rezip overhead
- Simple builder-based transformation model
- Supports:
* Injecting entries before/after the archive or individual entries
* Skipping entries
* Prepending text to existing files

== Philosophy

Archie promotes _streaming transformations_ of archives without hitting the disk or loading files completely into memory.

Any manipulation of an archive will involve copying the file once.  Archie allows building complex transformation rules
that act on entries during the streaming process.  The result is the compressed archive is never fully unpacked on disk
at any one time, yet very complicated manipulations can be done on each entry as they are individually streamed.

Useful in deployment pipelines, repackaging tools, or license/compliance stamping workflows.

== Getting Started

Add Archie to your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tomitribe</groupId>
    <artifactId>archie</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version> <!-- Replace with actual -->
</dependency>
----

=== Basic Example

Inject a `README.txt` into a JAR file:

[source,java]
----
Transformations transformations = Transformations.builder()
    .before(InsertEntry.builder()
        .name("README.txt")
        .content("Hello, World!")
        .build())
    .build();

new JarTransformation(transformations)
    .transform(new FileInputStream("input.jar"),
               new FileOutputStream("output.jar"));
----

=== Before / After Entry Injection

Insert content relative to an entry:

[source,java]
----
Transformations.builder()
    .beforeEntry(name -> name.endsWith("Red.class"), stream -> {
        stream.writeEntry("BeforeRed.txt", "Pre-content");
    })
    .afterEntry(name -> name.endsWith("Red.class"), stream -> {
        stream.writeEntry("AfterRed.txt", "Post-content");
    })
    .build();
----

=== Prepending to Existing Entries

[source,java]
----
Transformations.builder()
    .prepend(name -> name.equals("META-INF/LICENSE"),
        "Copyright Acme Corporation. 2025\n\n")
    .build();
----

== Supported Formats

Archie supports the following formats via dedicated transformation types:

- `JarTransformation`
- `ZipTransformation`
- `TarGzTransformation`

Each accepts the same `Transformations` model for consistent usage across formats.
